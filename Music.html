<p style="color:white;font-size:30;position:absolute;top:900px;right:950px;width:400px;height:500px">Hi, How Are You Is Daniel Johnston's Most Popular Album And One Of The Best Albums Of All Time. It Might Be A Bit Difficult To Get Used To As The Low Quality Sound Is Unconventional But If You Put That Aside It Is A Beautiful Album About Sorrow, Love, And Despair. </p>
<p style="color:white;font-size:30;position:absolute;top:900px;right:480px;width:400px;height:500px">Iowa Is The Second Studio Album By Slipknot. It Has A Dark, Angry, Hateful Atmosphere Reflected By The Attitudes Of The Band Members At The Time. It Has Sort Of A Nihilistic Feel To It Which Elevates The Music. The Album Itself Makes A Statement And Is A Necessary Listen. </p>

<p style="color:white;font-size:30;position:absolute;top:1700px;right:900px;width:400px;height:500px">OK Computer Is One Of The Most Influential And Important Albums Of All Time, Coming From The Two Previous More Rock Oriented Radiohead Albums, OK Computer Is A Very Different Album Focusing On More Melodic Slower Songs Rather Than The More Loud Rock Songs Of The Previous Two Albums, Another Thing That Makes This Album Unique Is How The Whole Album Makes A Statement And Tells A Story About Corruption, Dystopia, And Technology, Which Are All Things That Are Starting To Become Real Problems In The Modern Day Making This Album Very Influential And Ahead Of Its Time. </p>
<img src="kida.jpeg" style="position:absolute;top:1200px;right:200px;width:500px;height:500px">
<p style="color:white;font-size:30;position:absolute;top:1700px;right:200px;width:400px;height:500px"> Kid A Was The Fourth Studio Album By Alternative/Indie Rock Band Radiohead. At The Time Of Making This Album The Band Was Tired And Burnt Out But They Wanted To Make Another Album, Coming Off Of Two Rock Albums And One Semi-Rock Slower Melodic Album, The Band Wanted To Do Something Different, Something More Experimental, And So They Made Kid A Which Was A More Dark Disturbing Electronic Album, They Didnt Know If People Would Like It But They Made It Anyway And It Became One Of The Most Influential Indie Albums Of All Time. </p>

<p style="color:white;font-size:30;position:absolute;top:2700px;right:900px;width:400px;height:500px"> Issues Was An Album Made By Korn When Nu Metal Was In It's Prime, This Was Korn's Third Studio Album And In My Opinion, The Best. They Wanted To Make An Album That Was Oriented Around Trauma (Which They Had Experimented With Earlier With The Song 'Daddy') Specifically, The Trauma Of Lead Singer Jonathan Davis Who Had A Difficult Childhood. They Made Something Dark And Disturbing Meant To Make You Feel Pain And Since Then It Has Become One Of The Best Albums To Come Out Of Nu Metal And The 90's. </p>

<p style="color:white;font-size:30;position:absolute;top:2700px;right:200px;width:400px;height:500px"> Nevermind Is One Of The Biggest And Most Important And Influential Albums Of All Time And It Was The Album To Pioneer Grunge. Coming Off Of Their More Punk Oriented Debut Album 'Bleach' They Decided That They Wanted To Do Something Similar But Better With Nevermind, And With Creating One Of The Biggest Albums Of All Time, Its Safe To Say That They Succeeded. </p>

<p style="color:white;font-size:30;position:absolute;top:3600px;right:900px;width:400px;height:500px"> The Fourth Album Of The Influential Sludge Metal/Doom Metal Band Melvins Was One Of The Earliest Examples Of Grunge Themes Directly Inspiring Nirvana, Also Having Kurt Cobain Help Produce This Album. This Album Was Certainly Influential Inspiring Multiple Popular Bands Such As Soundgarden, Mastodon, Slipknot, And Even Nirvana. </p>
